# Railway-Reservation-And-Management-System
Brief description/br
● The mini-project entitled “Railway reservation management system“ is developed as apart
of Mini Project
● Our website has various kinds of information that helps regarding booking of tickets via
railways .
● Users will be able to search the train availability ,the exact fare ,the arrival and
departuretime of the train and they can also book the ticket by using the debit ,credit
or master card and after booking the ticket if the user want to cancel it then they can
easily do it also.

Objectives
The objective of the online railway reservation management system
Project is to design software to fully automate the process of issuing a railway ticket.
That is:-
1. To create a database of the trains
2. To search the trains it’s arrival and departure time,distance between source and
destination.
3.To check the availability of the ticket.
4. To calculate fare.
5.To book the ticket.
6.To cancel the ticket if necessary

 Scope
● Railway passengers frequently need to know about their ticket reservation status,
ticket availability on a particular train or for a place, train arrival or departure details,
special trains etc.. Customer information centers at the railway stations are unable to
serve such queries at peak periods.
● The number of the reservation counters available to the passengers and customers are very
less.
● On most of the reservation systems there are long queues, so it takes a long time for
any individual to book the ticket.As now there are no call centers facilities available
to solve the queries of the passengers.
● The online railway ticket reservation system aims to develop a web application which aims
at providing trains details, trains availability, as well as the facility to book ticket in online
for customers.
● So, we thought of developing a web based application which would provide the users all
these facilities from his terminal only as well as help them in booking their tickets. The
Application was to be divided into two parts namely the user part , and the administrator
part. And each of these has their corresponding features.We decided to give the name of the
website “RAILWAY RESERVATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”.The online railway
ticket reservation system is developed using ASP.NET with C# as the backend in the .NET
Framework.
